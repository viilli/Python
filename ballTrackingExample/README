Ball tracking example code. Code measure Distance to ball


1. Get a webcam it can be a phone. I personaly use android and DroidCam software. 

2. Go to line 40 in my code and put right number to "cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)" <-- HERE

3. after that is done run the code. I use Pycharm for this.

4. There will popup six windows. 
  - First mask
  - morphological transformation mask
  - drawContours
  - rectangle
  - colorTest
  - Cropped frame
  
  drawContours is for visualizer for masks
  rectangle is final output
  cropped frame show what rectangle window is targeted
  colorTest window is used to change values for get good contrast between ball and background. You have to get the ball white and background black for this to work

5. but ball front of the camera. camera have to see it fully. use ruler to measure distance to camera. I did put the camera to face up to sealing. then I put the ball 15cm
from the camera. mark down the distance and how many pixels is the ball wide in rectangle window. 

6. press 'k' to open calibration window. first input is for distance and second is for pixels. when you are ready press Calibrate button and close the window. that unfreeze
the other program. 

7. after that press 'ESC' it will close and stop program, but it will also save the settings and calibration so you dont have to do that every time. 

8. run code again. it will load the settings and you are good to go
